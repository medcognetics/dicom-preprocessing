            The target resolution will be computed from the native DICOM spacing and the desired spacing.
            If z-spacing is provided, z-axis interpolation is applied to match the target spacing.
        filter: Interpolation filter for resizing. One of: nearest, triangle, catmull, gaussian, lanczos3
        padding_direction: Direction to pad when aspect ratio doesn't match target. One of: zero, center, edge
        crop_max: Whether to crop to maximum possible size
        volume_handler: How to handle multi-frame volumes. One of: keep, central, interpolate.
            - keep: Keep all frames
            - central: Keep the central frame
            - interpolate: Interpolate to `target_frames` using linear interpolation along z-axis
        use_components: Whether to use color components for cropping

        target_frames: Target number of frames when using `volume_handler="interpolate"`.
            This parameter is used for z-axis interpolation when the interpolate handler is specified.
            Note: If z-spacing is provided in `spacing` parameter, it takes precedence over `target_frames`.
        convert_options: How to handle pixel data. One of: default, normalize.
